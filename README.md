A US Facility has 3rd party billing contract for its radiology services.
This biller has recently provided all billing data since October 2015.
The Data Team is interested in analyzing the biller's performance especially for the year 2018.

Typically, the facility performs service like Mammogram and the biller bills the insurance company a few days after the exam.
Insurance companies can deny or pay anytime after 7 days of receiving the bill.

Analysis should be focussed at:
1) Which parameters should the US facility analyze the biller on?
2) Is the company losing money? In what ways?
